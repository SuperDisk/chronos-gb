# Chronos

This is basically a hacked up version of [ZoomTen's Chronos ZX Beeper Music Disassembly](https://github.com/ZoomTen/chronos-zxbeeper), ported to work on the Game Boy.

Just run `build2.sh` to build the thing and enjoy. It seems to run slightly slower than the ZX Spectrum version for some reason which I'm not entirely sure of-- this is left as an exercise to the reader. Alright fine I'm just lazy.

Also included is a port of Tim's ["Star Tip 2" from Your Sinclair](http://craigsretrocomputingpage.eu5.org/startip2/tune_disassembly_hexdump.html). Run `build.sh` to make this.
